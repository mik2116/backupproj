##Squirrel Tracker

The purpose of this project is to pull a database of squirrel sightings from the Central
 Park Data Census and upload sightings onto a website, including an interactive map. The
 server also enables users to add new sightings, update current sightings, as well as vi
ew various statistics from the data collected.

The website can be reached [here](http://35.188.229.62/sightings/sightings/) which displ
ays all the sightings, and can redirect you to the [map](http://35.188.229.62/sightings/
map/) as well. You can edit past sightings by clicking on their ID on the page, and you 
can add new sightings by using the link on the page which redirects you [here](http://35.188.229.62/sightings/sightings/add).
